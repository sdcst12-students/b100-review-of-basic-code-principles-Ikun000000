### Assignment 4
#### Calculation of a debt repayment with recurring payments
This is the reverse of assignments 2 and 3

* an initial debt
* the annual interest rate

* the program will state how long it will take for the debt to be repaid.
* extra: Calculate the total amount of interest that is paid along with the debt repayment
